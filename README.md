# Slomo-and-Time-Lapse
Save a slow motion or Time Lapse video using Open_CV Python

Before starting with the code we shall understand a basic term called 'VIDEO'.

Video is an electronic medium for the recording,broadcasting and display of moving visual media.

That was a formal(from google) defination of video.. A video is created by just displaying image frames continuosly in a loop, well we can create a slomo / time lapse just by altering the number of frames per seconds (FPI)
